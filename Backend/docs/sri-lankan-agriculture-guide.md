## Introduction to Sri Lankan Agriculture {#introduction}

Sri Lanka's agriculture sector employs approximately 25% of the country's workforce and contributes significantly to the national economy. The island nation's tropical climate, diverse topography, and rich soil conditions create ideal environments for cultivating a wide variety of crops. Agriculture in Sri Lanka ranges from large-scale plantation crops like tea, rubber, and coconut to small-scale subsistence farming of rice, vegetables, and fruits.

The agricultural landscape is characterized by three main sectors:
- **Plantation Agriculture**: Tea, rubber, coconut, and spices
- **Paddy Cultivation**: Rice farming in irrigated and rain-fed areas
- **Other Food Crops**: Vegetables, fruits, pulses, and condiments

Traditional farming practices blend with modern agricultural techniques, creating a unique farming ecosystem. The majority of farmers operate small holdings of 1-2 hectares, making micro-farming techniques particularly relevant and important for sustainable agricultural development.

## Climate and Agro-Ecological Zones {#climate}

### Climate Overview
Sri Lanka experiences a tropical monsoon climate with two distinct monsoon seasons:
